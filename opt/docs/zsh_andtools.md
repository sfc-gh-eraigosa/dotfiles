I was watching a video on [gowest](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjSKj5JX7Fc), when I saw this cool git prompt.  I had heard about zsh and wanted to dig around some more, but after I saw the video, I just wanted it.

1. Setup [zsh](http://zsh.sourceforge.net/) ```sudo apt-get install zsh```
2. Setup [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh)
   * mkdir -p ~/opt/bin/om-my-zsh
   * export ZSH=~/opt/bin/om-my-zsh
   * wget --no-check-certificate http://install.ohmyz.sh -O - | sh
